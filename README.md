Hi, I'm Gyro ðŸ‘‹ â€” a 2nd-year BSIT student passionate about Java, web development, and databases.  
This repo is my **personal learning journey** as I build up the skills needed to work at **Accenture** and beyond.

## My Goals
To become confident in:
- Java (OOP, File I/O, JDBC, mini-projects)
- HTML & CSS (Responsive design, layouting)
- MySQL (SQL basics, joins, CRUD, integration with Java)

## Tools I Used
- Java 17
- MySQL 8
- VS Code / IntelliJ (Community Edition)
- Git & GitHub
- Notion (for notes)

## My Current Focus
Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Java File I/O and JDBC
- Responsive web design with CSS Flexbox & Grid
- SQL joins and database relationships

## Learning Milestones
- [ ] Core Java syntax & OOP
- [ ] Build basic login/register system in Java + MySQL
- [ ] Complete Inventory Management mini-project
- [ ] Build a personal web portfolio with HTML/CSS

## My Thought Process
This roadmap is not just for practice â€” itâ€™s my preparation for joining Accenture and growing into a full-stack developer and a software engineer.
